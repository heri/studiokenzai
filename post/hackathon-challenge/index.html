          <h1>48 Hours Climate Change hackathon</h1>
          <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 13, 2019</span>
          <p>I am participating this weekend in the AI Climate Change Hackathon, and I will jot down here my notes and progress. Here is the event pitch:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Join us along with the other talented and diverse participants, supported by leading mentors in their fields who will come together to collaborate to attempt to address climate change and its impacts on communities and ecosystems. We hope to begin to achieve real positive impact in 48 hours using AI. We are also announcing 4 AI challenges: Plant Village Challenge, Extreme Weather Prediction, Climate-Related Risk Assessment, and Predict the Weather in Montréal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sounds like a recipe to attract ecologists, students, and dreamers alike. It tells very little about technologies, specific goals and metrics, or even datasets, which are key in AI.</p>

<p>Neverthless, it should be a good opportunity to implement an idea I had recently.</p>

<p>A while ago, I used the iOS app Gyroscope, which excelled in giving you a picture of your daily health. The app has good integration with data providers like Garmin or Apple Health but it was also good at recognizing activities such as walking, biking or taking public transit. At the end of the day, a screen that I loved showed total energy expenditure, heart rates, sleep patterns and other core metrics.</p>

<p>Fitness apps are good into telling you if your work-out was good, but Gyroscope was better if overall, you were getting more fit (or more sedentary).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s this ability to track daily actions and giving you a 10,000 feet global view that I want to render, in the case of climate change. Imaging taking an Uber, then getting your Starbucks, having a hamburger at lunch later, then finally biking home. The app will then sum up in a screen what are the positive/negative impact of these actions. You can then share this easily on social media or just bask in what you&rsquo;ve done that day :)</p>

<p>One can even imagine, that given enough users and patterns, you could be recommended specific products or actions that improves your &ldquo;climate change balance&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now, if it sounds like I am a green die-hard activist. I am not at all. This is just 48 hours of my time trying to build an app that can help regular people in their daily life.</p>

<p>Now, a bit of background:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did outcomereference, which is able to correlate a food to diseases, and vice-versa. This project is still a work in progress, as it needs more precise statistical modeling, a course that was in my bottom 10 in engineering. But above all, it works and you can trust the results in any page.</li>
<li>I built a couple of self-driving RC vehicles, based on the donkeycar OSS. So I can do supervised learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision and more.</li>
<li>I also did a lot of AI modeling to know that you have to be either lucky or have an army of supervisers to get an accurate AI model. In 98% of cases, reverting to regression, medians or just brute-forcing with a database works better than an &ldquo;AI model&rdquo;</li>
<li>I did a dozen of web apps, back-end, API or full-stack</li>
<li>I can do design and UI but it will generally be poor. I&rsquo;m a sucker for slick designs so will need hel on this</li>
</ul>

<p>For this project, I foresee a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the datasets? and if there aren&rsquo;t any supplied, where do we get them?</li>
<li>Can you actually use an accurate AI model?</li>
<li>What are the metrics for positive/negative climate change actions? I can think of CO2, but it can be also CH4, or harmful substances (pesticides) and plastics generated</li>
<li>How do you present something that&rsquo;s simple and elegant for everyone?</li>
<li>Is there even time to train a model and get an accurate model?</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there are data, back-end, design challenges for this and I hope to write down here regularly the challenges, analysis, the range of solutions, and also what was the course taken.</p>

<p>To be continued. If you want to contact, I&rsquo;m on twitter @heri or heri [at] studiozenkai.com</p>
