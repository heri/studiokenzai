      <title>Building an autonomous RC car</title>

      <description>This is a hands-on article that encourages you to experiment and see what works on the ground.
Shameless Promotion: If you are in Montréal, I (@heri) do a meetup where people interested in computer vision, AI, robotics work on autonomous cars. Please drop by!
Why a RC car? Like developing an application, my recommendation is to build first a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Then iterate it quickly from there towards a version that works for you.</description>

      <title>All I want for Christmas is a small phone</title>

      <description>I got an iPhone 6S Plus a few years ago. I was impressed by the screen, the biggest I’ve had. Look! I can use it as a tablet. Watch videos everywhere, or showcase my latest work at a tech meetup.
The dreams shattered in many pieces. I was biking happily, the phone was sticking out of my pocket and crashed to the ground.
I bike a lot, hike, run around hilly tracks and never cracked a screen before the iPhone 6S Plus.</description>

      <title>Looking again at Microsoft</title>

      <description>The natural cycle of companies is to innovate. The flame dies down, then it fights again to innovate.
Microsoft is one of those. Win 3.1 was revolutionary, and so was Win 95. With Win 3.1, you could point and click to start programs. With Windows 95, you could install games with a nice GUI instead of typing arduous commands in MS-DOS. No more failures at the video setup or having to find a driver file for your sound card.</description>

      <description>I shipped many applications, using a variety of frameworks, through my current 1 year challenge or startups. Ruby issues include low performance, such as servers needing more RAM, not able to sustain large traffic, or slow rendering. Since this is a recurring issue, here is a checklist to help developers get their Ruby app faster:
Code complexity Ruby&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and ease of use allows beginners and experienced developers alike to ship features in record time.</description>

      <title>Why my next laptop won&#39;t be an Apple</title>

      <description>Part I - Apple&amp;rsquo;s Craftmanship I have used the original macbook, the 13&amp;rdquo; MacBook Air, the 13&amp;rdquo; Macbook pro, and 15&amp;rdquo; Macbook pros.
I loved the white plastic of the original macbook. It was better than any other computer I&amp;rsquo;ve used before, worked out of the box, and iMovie amazed me. Drag, drop, and five minutes later, you have a video.
I thought this is what computing should be.</description>

      <title>Why bots are a thing now</title>

      <description>Upon hearing about Facebook and Microsoft efforts to deploy bot platforms, a friend reacted:
 So bots are a thing now? I programmed bots 20 years ago
 He is a successful technology entrepreneur and has developed systems on many platforms. I can understand him. There were tutorials in kids&amp;rsquo; magazines on writing a &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; bot on MS-DOS 20 years ago. More impressive were the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) found in games like Warcraft 3 or Command &amp;amp; Conquer.</description>

      <title>Becoming a self-taught programmer</title>

      <description>In six months I have shipped many apps, as an entrepreneur or as a freelancer. I have also contributed to open source projects and advised other projects. Yet I’m educated as an electrical engineer, not as a software engineer and consider myself largely self-taught in the area of programming.

      <title>Cuda Cores Ranking for Machine learning</title>
      <link>http://studiozenkai.com/post/cuda/</link>

      <description>NVIDIA graphic cards can be used to accelerate scientific computing, neural networks, video games and occasionally bitcoin computing.
Video editing and post-production also benefit greatly from NVIDIA cards with Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Mercury Engine or BMD&amp;rsquo;s Davinci resolve.
In the case of scientific computing, performance is directly proportional to the number of cuda cores. As long as cpu speed is &amp;gt; 2GHz and you have as much RAM as you have GPU RAM, you are all good.</description>
