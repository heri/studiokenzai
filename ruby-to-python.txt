before :  autonomous RC Car
now : data engineering , ETLs, plus serving tensorflow models on a flask web api

common
- intuitive

- lots of libraries
    - hardware
    - dataframe, numpy
- speed
    - compiled to C
    - gpu

going backwards. 

- uncanny similarity. You can read it, and understand it. But then when you try to make it your own, it doesn't work out because actually there's something tiny that's different. 
- having to write len(object)
- no magic stuff. needs an explicit convert to dict , to list and so on
- lots of poeople who are interested in the beauty of code
    - and then lots of people who copy and paste
    - also lots of people who are fascists and then criticize you for not following standards
    - so if this is building a house, this is the person who criticize you because you put 4 layers of paint instead of 3 but didn't see that the house is crooked in itself
- indenting? wtf are we back to high school?

So what's the future?

Is Heri going to be a Python developer? or a Ruby developer

There's something for sure : Deep learning, autonomous robots. And that is Pythin world. And only for that I would do more Python.

You *cannot* forgot Ruby or Rails though. It's still by far the fastest way to output a web2.0 application - think shopify, github. It's a king for hackathons, small to mid-sized projects. I still code projects
